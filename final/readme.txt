EXCEEDING THE REQUIREMENTS:

Foundation #1: Abstraction
This project exceeds requirements by adding a program that finds and then shows both the longest and shortest comments on each video. 

Foundation #2: Encapsulation
This project exceeds requirements by introducing inventory management. After placing
an order, the user can then update product stock levels. This is similar to real systems used in grovery stores.

Foundation #3: Inheritance
This project exceeds requirements through an event search feature that will prompt the user to input a date and then it will show all activities scheduled for that specific date.

Foundation #4: Polymorphism
This project exceeds requirements by giving the user the choice to use miles or
kilometers with all of the calculations automatically switching based on the user's desired units.
